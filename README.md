### TODO List

1. Deploy this project to Vercel, so that we can see live changes in "production".
2. Show me that your API hello world route actually works, because I don't think it works when under `poc_1/api`. I think it needs to be `src/app/api` (but I could possibly be wrong).
3. Continue to work on POC1, fetching a list of Sheets for a given user.

### Proof of Concepts List

1. Make an demo of listing a userâ€™s Google Sheets: https://chat.openai.com/share/e4c047f0-dd13-4661-b98c-46c7c0074771
   11:25
2. Given a selected Sheet, extract the data and display it to the screen
3. NextJS TypeScript Demo that connects to the Google Translate API and does a single translation

### Some Proof of Concept work using NextJS

Run `npm install`.

then `npm run dev` to test current implementation.

Thus far, P.O.C. #1 has been implemented, just a simple storage of some example data in the backend called using NextJS' app router. Will continue to iterate with P.O.C. #2, storing data from user's google sheets in the NextJS backend.
